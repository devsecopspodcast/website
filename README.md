## We talk like no one is listening except that we record it

This is the show by and for DevSecOps practitioners who are trying to survive information overload, get through marketing nonsense, do right technology bets, help their organizations to deliver value and last but not the least to have some fun. Tune in for talks about technology, ways of working and news from DevSecOps.

We created this podcast because we realized that we were not the only ones to struggle with security on a daily basis.
It is also difficult to find information without marketing content or a product pitch.
We don't intend to sell anything, now or later.

This show is not sponsored by any technology vendor and we are trying to be as unbiased as possible.
We talk like no one is listening! For good or bad ðŸ˜‰.

### What is DevSecOps

As DevOps improved the collaboration between developers (dev) and operations (ops),
DevSecOps includes security aspects into the development and operation of applications.
It adds the dimension of security to a DevOps culture.

Enjoy the talks and feel free to participate.
