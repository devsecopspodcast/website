Our first episode was about Infrastructure as code, and we feel that it is time to revisit the topic after almost two years. Another reason is the release of the second edition of Infrastructure as Code book by Keif Morris. Thus, in this episode, we revisit the definition of Infrastructure as code and try to summarize what has changed over the years. We hope you like it!
