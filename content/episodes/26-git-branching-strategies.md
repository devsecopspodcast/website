[Johan Abildskov](https://twitter.com/RandomSort)([see episode 6](https://devsecops.fm/episodes/semver-or-not-to-semver/)) is back,
and we are talking branching strategies! In particular, why you shouldn't be doing git-flow,
and what are other options out there. This conversation takes us down memory lane to a more
broad discussion about version control systems, mono-repositories, continuous integration,
and delivery. We hope you will like it!
