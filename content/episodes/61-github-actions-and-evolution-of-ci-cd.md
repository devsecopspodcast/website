Andrey has been exploring GitHub Actions and has some insights to share. How have CI/CD solutions transformed over time, and what innovations do GitHub Actions bring to the table? Julien drops a few tools that could be useful for GitHub Actions users.
We explored a bit history of CI/CD, we started with Jenkins and its DSL in Groovy.
We compared that to the current DSL in YAML (GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build, Azure DevOps, AWS CloudBuild).
Andrey gave his tips on using Bash inside YAML and pipeline management. Mattias shared his experience on building pipeline.
