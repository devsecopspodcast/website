- bash is the future of automation (not really, but some people think so)
- building multi-cloud solutions using k8s and service mesh solutions
- Shuttle - CLI for handling shared build and deploy tools between projects no matter what technologies the projects are using https://github.com/lunarway/shuttle
- when is it the time to start looking into the building application delivery platform
