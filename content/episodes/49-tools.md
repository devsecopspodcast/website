This is a mixed bag of an episode, we chat about all sorts of digital tools and security practices that we use in our day-to-day lives. We start by talking about password managers, and why Julien still using LastPass after the recent LastPass data breach. Julien gives us the lowdown on his personal approach to handling passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens, showing us why strong security measures matter.

Julien also shares his favorite email alias service and we discuss services for sharing sensitive information to keep mail inboxes cleaner and more private.

We also spoke about ChatGPT, an AI language model from OpenAI - will it replace jobs? should we be using it? And how?

Just a heads up, we aren't sponsored by companies we mention in this episode. We're just sharing our personal experiences and the stuff we like to use.
