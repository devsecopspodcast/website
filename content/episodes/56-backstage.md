In this episode of DevSecOps Talks, join Andrey, Julien, and Mattias as they dive into the world of Backstage, the notable internal development platform. Mattias is keen to peel back the layers and understand what makes people think of Backstage as a must-have in modern DevOps toolchains. Andrey highlights the platform's core feature: a comprehensive registry that keeps track of every software service running within a company. Could this signify a revival of IT change management, but with a twist? We've moved on from the days of cumbersome ticketing systems to streamlined internal development platforms. The team also ponders the future role of infrastructure engineers as they navigate the rising tides of AIâ€”will AI become the new face behind these developer portals? Tune in to find out!
