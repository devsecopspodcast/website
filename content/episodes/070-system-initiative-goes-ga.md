Andrey, Mattias, and Paulina are joined by Paul Stack, an IaC tools developer and a frequent guest on the show. He’s back to discuss the general availability of System Initiative and share what has changed since his last visit when they talked about the early beta of the tool. Will this be a revolution or evolution in Infrastructure as Code tooling? Do we really need collaborative infrastructure management tools? Tune in to find out!
