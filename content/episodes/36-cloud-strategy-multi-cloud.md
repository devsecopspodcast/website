In this episode, we will discuss what kind of strategy one needs in order to be multi-cloud. 
Kubernetes allowed us to use a common API to run compute across various infrastructure but not everything is kubernetes native. 
To migrate to a new cloud provider, we need a strategy.
What should be abstracted away? 
What should be built or own by the teams? 
What should be outsourced to the cloud providers ?
Bash and jq became the most used tool for infrastructure in Russia over Ansible. (link?)
Conclusion: Platform team should be enablers instead of gatekeepers. Multi-cloud strategies are there to be able to negociate with cloud providers and threaten them to leave. Team topology, who serves who, is one of the most important part of the organization.
