Diving into the world of bare-metal servers, Mattias takes the helm solo for this episode. He's accompanied by special guests Michael Wagner and Ian Evans from Metify, the company that powers Mojo - a leading platform for bare-metal provisioning automation.

While we often chat about the big cloud service providers, this time we're switching gears. If you've been curious about how real-world, physical servers are set up and managed, this episode is just for you. Join Mattias, Michael, and Ian as they dive into the nuts and bolts of setting up servers - a topic that Mattias is super passionate about.
