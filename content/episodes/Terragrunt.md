Our guest speaker is [Anton Babenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonbabenko/),
he is DevSecOps Talks podcast fan, AWS Community Hero, Terraform fanatic, HashiCorp Ambassador and a prolific open source contributor.
After listening to episode [#9 Terraform in CI](https://devsecops.fm/episodes/terraform-in-ci/) and [#1 Infrastructure as code](https://devsecops.fm/episodes/infrastructure-as-code/),
Anton decided that enough is enough and volunteered to give his point of view on Terragrunt since he though that we are missing a few important points.
In this episode, we are discussing the use cases of [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/),
a wrapper around Terraform for working with multiple environment and modules.
