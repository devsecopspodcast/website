Initially, we planned this episode as a discussion about HashiCorp Nomad and invited Jacob LÃ¤rfors. He recently published a great article about his experience working with Nomad (see link in the show notes).
However, because of a few postponements, and with HashiConf that happened just a week ago, we decided to extend the podcast's scope to go over all of the announcements that they did during the conference.
So here it is - HashiConf special: all you need to know about everything that HashiCorp announced during the conference plus a discussion about Nomad!
