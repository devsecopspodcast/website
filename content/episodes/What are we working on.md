We had a few potential topics for this episode but before getting started with them we decided to discuss what technological problems we were solving during the last two weeks.
As it turns out there were quite a lot to discuss.
Tune in for tips on auditing ssh session through a jump host,
preventing downloads from AWS S3 even if you got read access,
credentials in Git repository, why you should (or should not) use Kubernetes and more.
