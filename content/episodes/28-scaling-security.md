The real cloud lock-in is security! Every service/cloud provider has its own levels of granularity regarding resources. Cloud engineering is mainly about compute, storage, and networking and how to make them scale. Scaling security is often left out as it is hard to measure on so many levels.

We think that it is a myth and that we can measure how many steps it takes to add, modify or remove access rights. It all starts with monitoring, knowing what is there in a cloud infrastructure is a very good first step. By making it easy to see and manage access rights, we make it easier for ourselves to keep resources secured.
