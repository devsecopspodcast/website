Our dialogue with Paul Stack resumes on DevSecOps Talks, almost two years after our initial podcast about his work on Pulumi (episode 25). As a warm-up, we talk about what prompted his move from Pulumi and his take on Open Terraform drama. The main topic of the episode is Paul's current focus, System Initiative; we probe into its purpose, the progress so far, and the promise it holds for redefining how we think of doing Infrastructure as Code and DevSecOps workflows in general.
