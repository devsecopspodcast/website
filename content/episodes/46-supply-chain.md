We are happy to welcome back Jacob LÃ¤rfors, CEO and Senior Consultant from Verifa, to talk about software supply chain attacks. It feels important to raise this topic since those attacks start to be utilized more often by sophisticated adversaries. At the same time, software supply chain security is something that companies often overlook. We as practitioners have so many things to consider and do that, in most cases, we do not have enough cognitive capacity left when looking into our library sources. What are the things we need to be aware of, and what are the low-hanging fruits we could utilize to help developers do their job securely?
