We had the opportunity to talk with Neatsun Ziv, one of the founders of Ox Security, about the Open Source Software Supply Chain Attack Reference Framework (https://pbom.dev). We delved deeper into possible attack vectors and explored ways to mitigate some of them. During our discussions, we also had a couple of unusual takes on supply chain security. If you are looking to understand the Open Source Software Supply Chain, then this episode is perfect for you.
