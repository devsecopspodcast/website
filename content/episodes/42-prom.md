Just get that helm chart installed, and here you go - metrics question sorted out. Want to monitor endpoints - here is BlackBox exporter for you. Want to get notifications - AlertManager got you covered. And so on and so on. But is it all rainbows and unicorns? You probably guessed that it depends. This time, Semyon is joining us to air his grievances with Prometheus and share insights on how to cook it if you decide to go down this route.
