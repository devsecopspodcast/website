This time we are talking unikernles! [Ian Eyberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianeyberg/) from [NanoVMs](https://nanovms.com/) joins us to discuss how far this technology is from prime time. And it turns out that you don't have to be a kernel developer to take advantage of unikernes. Today, there are tools available to package, distribute, and run them locally as well as in the public cloud. While talking to Ian, it felt that the state of the technology is very similar to Linux containers at the beginning of 2010x, just before Docker made Linux containers available for everyone.
