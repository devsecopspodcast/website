Last week (week 6, 2021), seven data breaches were announced. In this episode, we discuss the possible scenarios for preventing attackers from getting a hold of your data, whether private or company data. And tips on how to mitigate the consequences of data leaks in cases when you have no control over data management (think of breach of 3rd party service).
